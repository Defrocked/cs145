Ames, Iowa
I moved from here last summer. This town was great for getting around on a bike. In the winter, I rode the bus and got to read a lot of books. I once found $20 on Duff Avenue. We owned a home here for a year. After we learned we were coming to Eau Claire, it sold in 10 days!

A Long Drive (For Us)
My wife and I married right after college and then went down to Knoxville, TN. It was very different down there and the drive back to Iowa was long. My fondest return trip involved a surprise stop at Kickapoo State Park where we want canoeing. Every time we cross Wisconsin's Kickapoo River (which is a lot, as it meanders), we think back to that park. Another trip we slept in the car and woke up surrounded by deer. However great the park was, it was always a joy to get to my in-laws house in Vinton, IA.

Putnam Park, Eau Claire, WI
After a long day of grading and writing haiku, these woods are a great place to go for a run. There's a lot of smart weed, so long pants are a must. You'll have to duck and jump a lot, and you can expect to eat some spiderwebs in the less-visited western half. The clearing leads up the bluff and comes out very near Charter Bank; I once walked it to make a deposit.
